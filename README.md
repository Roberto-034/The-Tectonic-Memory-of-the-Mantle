# The-Tectonic-Memory-of-the-Mantle
Supplementary material for the thesis "The Tectonic Memory of the Mantle" by Robert Marks (UOW 2022)


The Jupyter notebooks files contain all functions necessary for the analysis that was carried out within this thesis. All code here was written by the author of this thesis.
Also within is the .yml file detailing the Anaconda environment that the primary Jupyter notebook works within (PyGMT environment).

There are also supplementary figures which include:
1) Binary classification maps for all depths for each model
2) Tracked slab paths for all seed ages for each model

** Figures are collected in MP4 files. To view: download file, open, pause, and scroll through time to view desired figure.
